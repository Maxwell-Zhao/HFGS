# [BMVC2024] HFGS: 4D Gaussian Splatting with Emphasis on Spatial and Temporal High-Frequency Components for Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction

A large number of pretrained models with different speed-accuracy trade-offs for flow, stereo and depth are available at MODEL_ZOO.md. We assume the downloaded weights are located under the pretrained directory.
